# flask-devops-deploy-notes
repository serves as a sandbox for devops and deployment patterns which I can reference, as well as share with those passing through.

Currently Implemented
- Docker configuration for Flask Backend, Postgres DB, Redis instance, and RQ Workers
- AWS configuration

TODO:
- Add ElasticSearch docker instance
- Add Database Population services
- Change File Structure [remove flask_dev]
- Change flask directory name to [flask_docker_dev] (something more descriptive!)
